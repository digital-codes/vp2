Vuepress2 Test

## Issues
### Wrong vuepress
after a fresh install, dev and build might not work. Potential reason is 
wrong link fÃ¼r vuepress binary.
Check directory node_module/.bin
vuepress -> ../vuepress-webpack/bin/vuepress.js

vuepress must be linked to vuepress-webpack/bin/vuepress.js
not to vuepress-vite/bin/vuepress.js

### vue3-component-base

issue in vue3-component-base, simple fix available, see PR at
